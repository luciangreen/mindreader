%% The algorithm has at times projected and identified my thought correctly but many of the figures are too similar

%% Sometimes I had the feeling of a quick representation taken from me before I could speak, people "talking for me" (in any case, a false reading) and other options appearing above mine, and sometimes breasonings I said "stickily" matching a different option from what I meant registered as the option
