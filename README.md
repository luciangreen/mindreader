**Currently Not Working**

Mindreader is currently not working even if 10 algorithms are inductively written for each mind read person per day.  It does not necessarily require the computer to meditate.

# Mindreader

Contains Prolog programs that can be used by an individual to project spiritual images and read their mind using meditation.

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for writing code.

# Prerequisites

Install List Prolog Interpreter Repository (https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter) first.

# Installing and Preparation

Download Lucian Green's List Prolog Interpreter Repository and this repository.

**Caution**

- Before running texttobr-based mind reader, think of two radio buttons put on recordings, put through with prayer, nut and bolt, quantum box prayer 1, 1, 0.5 cm and 1, 1, 0.5 cm.

- Follow instructions in https://github.com/luciangreen/listprologinterpreter/blob/master/Instructions_for_Using_texttobr(2).pl.txt when using texttobr, texttobr2 or mind reader to avoid medical problems.

Please follow instructions in init.txt to initialise any new mind-reading algorithms.

See instructions on running below

 **Important:** Eliminate interference once you have got the algorithm working with 4*4000 breasonings for it working: ['texttobr2'].  texttobr2(64). and eliminating any instances of interference with 250 breasonings: texttobr2(2). (2) for dotting on and doing it.

Additional instructions for preparing to run screen projector:
Breason out songs used to help project pixels.
```
['texttobr2'].
['texttobr'].
texttobr2(u,"file-songs.txt",u,u).
texttobr(u,"file-songs.txt",u,u).

['postsong'].
postsong(10).  %% For ten songs
```
Write a spiritual letter to your federal government (with a done up A per sentence) to activate the technology.
```
texttobr2(u,"letter.txt",u,u).
texttobr2(u,"file-letter.txt",u,u).
```

Running
Recognise you thinking of objects
```
['mindreadtestobj-12scrn-2'].
sectest(1).
```
Replace 1 with the number of times to repeat algorithm.

Recognise you thinking of more objects
```
['mindreadtestobj-12scrn-2medit'].
sectest(1).
```
Replace 1 with the number of times to repeat algorithm.

Recognise you thinking of characters
```
['mindreadtestobj-12scrn-2chars'].
sectest(1).
```
Replace 1 with the number of times to repeat algorithm.
